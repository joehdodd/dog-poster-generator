# Getting Started with Dog-Poster-Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`yarn` installs project dependencies, `yarn start` runs the project.

A `.env` is included that has the base URL to the `dog.ceo` API.

## Packages

`axios` for API requests
`redux` (and dependencies) for state management
`material-ui` for view components
